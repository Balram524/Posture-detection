# Posture Detection using PoseNet and ml5.js

This project is designed to detect human posture by utilizing the PoseNet model with the help of the ml5.js library. The PoseNet model identifies 17 key points on the human body, allowing it to accurately estimate human poses. You can test the live demo [here](https://balram524.github.io/Posture-detection/).

## Overview

This project is based on the PoseNet State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) paper, and it uses ml5.js, a friendly machine learning JavaScript library, to simplify the implementation of PoseNet in a web environment. The model works by detecting various key points on the human body, such as the eyes, nose, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Posture Detection**: Detects 17 key points on the human body.
- **ml5.js Integration**: Leverages ml5.js to implement machine learning in JavaScript easily.
- **PoseNet Model**: Uses the PoseNet architecture for pose estimation, as referenced in the SOTA paper.
- **Browser-Based**: Runs directly in a web browser without needing additional installations.

## Technologies Used

- **ml5.js**: JavaScript library that wraps TensorFlow.js for easy implementation of machine learning models.
- **PoseNet**: Pretrained deep learning model for human pose estimation.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For front-end development and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/balram524/Posture-detection.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to start detecting postures in real time.
